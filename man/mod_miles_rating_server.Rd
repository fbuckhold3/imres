\description{
This function encapsulates all server-side logic for the milestone rating
interface. It expects an externally provided reactive period. Until a valid
period is supplied, a blank screen (or prompt) is shown. If the period is
"Interim Review," a message is displayed stating that milestone ratings are not
necessary. Otherwise, the full rating interface is rendered and the user cannot
proceed to the next milestone until a selection is made on the current one.
