\title{Utilities for Wrangling Resident Assessment and Faculty Evaluation Data}
\usage{
wrangle_assessment_data(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataframe containing the raw resident assessment data.}
}
\value{
A cleaned and wrangled dataframe with consistent 'name' and 'record_id' columns.
}
\description{
This file contains utility functions to clean, organize, and merge resident data from multiple sources.
The wrangling is essential for ensuring complete and accurate data prior to visualization and analysis.
}
\details{
## Function Overview:
- `wrangle_assessment_data`: Cleans and processes resident assessment data.
- `create_res_data`: Creates a merged dataframe from assessment data and resident identifier (rdm) data.

These utilities are used to prepare data for Shiny apps and data visualizations.

Wrangle Resident Assessment Data

Cleans and processes raw resident assessment data by coalescing columns, 
creating week-based evaluation bins, and identifying academic years and PGY levels.

**Key Steps:**
- Converts and formats assessment dates.
- Coalesces multiple redundant "name" and "rotation" columns into single columns.
- Determines the academic year and PGY level of each resident at the time of assessment.
- Removes unnecessary columns.
